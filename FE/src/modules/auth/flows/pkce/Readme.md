# Modern Auth Flow – Recommended for Scalable Systems or 3rd-Party Providers

This is a new authentication flow that I highly recommend if you're:
- Working in a large-scale system
- Integrating with 3rd-party identity providers (like Auth0, Google, GitHub, etc.)

Feel free to clone/copy this flow/code — just plug in your own APIs and UI.  
Hope it saves you hours of head scratching 🔧✨

### 🧠 Key Concepts: `Client Code` & `Server Code`

- **Client Code**: A unique identifier created on the client side — used to prove _you_ initiated the auth request
- **Server Code**: A token/code generated by the server to complete the login flow

#### 🛫 Analogy:
Think of `Client Code` as your **ID card**  
And `Server Code` as your **plane ticket**

To check-in, you need **both**.  
Same idea applies here.

### 🧩 How It Works – Step by Step

0. **Create a Client Code**
   - Generate on frontend (e.g. UUID)
   - Hash it using a method like `SHA-256`

1. **Send Initial Auth Request**
   - Payload: `ClientCodeHashed` + `hashMethodName` (e.g. "sha256")
   - This tells the server you're about to start the login process

2. **Authenticate with Identity Provider**
   - Server handles login with Google/GitHub/Auth0/etc.
   - On success, server responds or redirects back to your app with a `ServerCode`

3. **Complete Auth Flow**
   - App sends another request to the server
   - Payload: original `Client Code` + `Server Code`

4. **Server Verifies and Issues Token**
   - If both codes match the session: returns `access_token`
   - You now have access to protected resources

### 🔐 Why This Matters

- Keeps auth logic more secure and traceable
- Avoids full reliance on redirects/callbacks
- Gives frontend more control in distributed or mobile environments

---

### ⚠️ Notes

- You must **hash the client code** before sending to the server  
- This flow assumes your server has a way to **track session state** between steps
- Works best when serverless/backend + auth provider both involved

### BTW:

> Separate "who sent the request" (`Client Code`) and "who was authorized" (`Server Code`)  
> Combine them to prove identity and complete login  
> Great for scalable, secure, multi-device flows 🚀
