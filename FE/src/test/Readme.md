# Hey there ðŸ‘‹

## First things you need to know:
This is a personal project built by ME, someone at Junior level â€” just to get more hands-on experience.

## Itâ€™s not a core banking app.
## Itâ€™s not handling millions of dollars.
## Itâ€™s definitely not launching rockets ðŸš€.

ðŸ‘‰ Itâ€™s just a simple frontend web app.

### So here's the deal:
- I only implemented simple unit tests for UI components and custom hooks.
- My main goal here is to understand and practice testing in a real-world-ish setup.
- No full E2E or 100% coverage â€” just clean and meaningful tests where it counts.

Thanks for checking it out!
