# This is a simple serverless backend

## Disclaimer:

I only have a "system-thinking" mindset, not actual backend coding skills

I'm not a backend or fullstack developer

So, the code in the BE folder is basically an "AI-generated mess" â€” don't use it in your project

Using backend like a middleware layer between sdk and FE, to make sure understand "how it work" when working with real life product
What that mean? that mean in real life, 99% you will working with API, it just response JSON to you, not something like sdk
